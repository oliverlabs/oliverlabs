# About Me
- 👋 Hi, I’m Oliver.
- ☁️ I am a Senior Cloud Solution Architect at Microsoft.
- 👀 I specialise in Microsoft Azure core infrastructure (compute, networking, storage) as well as PaaS services, but I am also knowledgeable in DevOps (GitHub and Azure DevOps), Modern Workplace, Cybersecurity, Enterprise Administration, and Power Platform. I frequently dabble in App Innovation space, especially in Kubernetes (AKS).
- 🌱 I am a big proponent of Infrastructure as Code or Everything as Code and Agile ways of working.
