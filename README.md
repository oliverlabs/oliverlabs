# About Me
- 👋 Hi, I’m Oliver.
- ☁️ I am a Senior Cloud Solution Architect at Microsoft.
- 👀 I specialise in Microsoft Azure core infrastructure (compute, networking, storage) as well as PaaS services. I often lean towards App Innovation and Cloud Native approach to application development. I also know a thing or two about DevOps (GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps), Modern Workplace, Cybersecurity, Enterprise Administration, and Power Platform. I frequently dabble in App Innovation space, especially in Kubernetes (AKS).
- 🌱 I am a big proponent of Infrastructure as Code (Bicep) or Everything as Code, as well as Agile ways of working.
- :octocat: I sometimes contribute to Microsoft Learn (Docs) and Microsoft CAF/WAF frameworks.
